# wasm-intro/importexport

A trivial example of:

- Defining a WASM function in C
- Defining an external function callable from C
- Loading a WASM module, providing external functions and calling a WASM function from JavaScript

The page loads the WASM module and calls it to call a JavaScript function to add two integers together.
