# wasm-intro/memory

A trivial example of:

- Defining a WASM function in C
- Defining external functions callable from C
- Accessing WASM linear memory from both JavaScript and C
- Loading a WASM module and calling a WASM function from JavaScript

The page loads the WASM module, then manipulates and reads its exported memory using both JavaScript typed arrays and C pointers.
